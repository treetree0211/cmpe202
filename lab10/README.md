AspectJ Comparing with Lab1 of Gumball machine 

- For lab1,  I used 4 child classes to implement cost25 cost50 and other kinds of Gumball Machine, 
  and if I want to create a new kind of Gumball machine, I need to create a new class and initiate a new instance
  to perform the turncrunk or insertcoin method

- For AspectJ, we can simply change classes by selecting configrations in the config file, if we want to add a new kind of 
  Gumball Machine, we can simply add new AspectJ file
