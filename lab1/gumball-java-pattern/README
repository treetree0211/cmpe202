In this project, I created variables as followings to support 3 Model Gumball Machines:

1. int type : parameter for storing machine types, type 1 for machine that only needs one quarter; type 2 for machine that needs two quarters; type 3 for machine that needs 50 cents, including any kinds of coin

2. int cost : parameter for storing how many coins each machine needs

3. int quarterNum : parameter for storing how many quarter already inserted

4. int collectCoinSum : parameter for storing how much money already inserted

****************************************************************************

I updated functions as followings

1. void insertCoin(int coin) : I added parameter for this function, according to coin value, I increment quarterNum if coin is 25, and increment collectCoinSum as well. For other kinds of coins, increment collectCoinSum; When it is in the noCoinState, I updated the function to display how much money we need for differnent machine and what kinds of coin we inserted.

2. void turnCrunk() : According to different type of machines, I compare the quarterNum with quarter needs and collectCoinSum with machine cost. If both meets requirements and gumball exists, user get gumball. Otherwise, check if needs more coins or gumballs
